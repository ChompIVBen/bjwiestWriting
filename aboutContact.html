    <br>
    <p1>I was on a marijuana trip (possible) and I had this burning inclination to finally get my writing at least
        somewhere.
        A website I can share around and have as my own. <br>
        I write a lot as therapy. I think it's that at least. I also write to shut my brain off of certain ideas.
        These ideas aren't always deep or troublesome, some are just like mental<br> scratches that I have to
        regurgitate.
        And I think that the need for that regurgitation is why I feel comfortable putting so much time and effort into
        my writing.
        I feel like <br>it's almost chosen me more than I've chosen it. If you want to know any more about me, email me.
        Have fun on this site. Hit me up about anything. Please also feel free<br> to email me and debate my ideas so I
        can work on not
        thinking that I'm right all the time and educate me. <br>
        Peace and love, man.
